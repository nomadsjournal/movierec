# Overview 

## Objective 
Build a recommendation engine using MovieLens datasets to predict user’s movie interest. 

## Motivation 
Recommendation engines are versatile and being needed/used across many industries - media (news), entertainment (streaming), e-commerce, social media, etc. I want to see how I can build a recommendation engine with movie datasets to do the following:

- Suggest movies based on other user's ratings
- Suggest movies based on movie features
- Predict user’s rating for movies, so that I can suggest movies they might like

## Value 
This exercise will give insight to the business to:
- Predict what users like to make decisions on content
- Create a curated experience for users in the sea of choices

## You can see me using...
- Data Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Feature Engineering: PCA, CountVectorizer, one-hot encoding
- Models: NearestNeighbors (Unsupervised), Keras Embedding (Supervised)


## Dataset

## To improve
Originally, I wanted to build a class that recommends movies based on the features that I've built. However, I wasn't able to do that due to tight timeframe. I am planning to improve movie recommendations considering user experience, then build classes in the future.
